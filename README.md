## Topic
#### Development of an Interactive application for clustering data by one's preferences in music.
## Description of the project
##### The program aims to clusterize data based on a person’s preferences in music and find correlation between their preferences and mental health. 
##### During the analysis, we also aim to compare 3 different clustering methods in order to find differences between them and determine the best method.
##### The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/catherinerasgaitis/mxmh-survey-results/data) used in this project.
## Requirements
### Programming language
##### The application will be developed using C++ and the Qt framework for the GUI. 
##### Code Style used: using namespace std, Google code style.
### Interface approach
##### Develop a user interface that allows users to interact with the project in different ways. 
##### Interface will include 4 blocks with widgets such as input and output of data, options for clusterization algorithms and graphics view.  
### External data handling
##### Capability to read .csv files (datasets) and write .txt files (output files). 
### Error handling
##### Use of “throw” and ”catch” methods to handle errors which would otherwise crash the program/make it unusable
### Object-oriented features
##### 1. Implementation of Setters and Getters for manipulating class properties. 
##### 2. Overloading of operators for enhanced class functionality. 
##### 3. Use of hierarchy to create a hierarchical structure of classes.
## Interface of the project
#### 1. Choosing a csv file
#### 2. Choose a clustering algorithm
    Cluster by hierarchy
    Cluster by medoids
    Cluster by means
#### 3. Showcase silhouette data
#### 4. Extract silhouette data into a separate file
#### 5. Compare silhouette files
#### 6. Documentation
## Tasks in github project
#### 1. Project initialization
    Set up the Git repository with a README and the initial project structure.
#### 2. Implement read from csv
#### 3. Implement 3 clustering algorithms
    Clustering by hierarchy
    Clustering by medoids
    Clustering by means
#### 4. Implement interpreting algorithm
#### 5. Implement GUI
#### 6. Write documentation
